# Learning JavaScript from 30 Days of JavaScript

IÂ´m taking this [30 days of javascript by Asabeneh](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript) challenge to improve and continue learning JavaScript.

I said I would not continue this challenge because of messy exercises and frustration, but I decided that I will keep it up with the challenge, only doing some of the exercises, with the objetive of learning and practice only the necessary.
